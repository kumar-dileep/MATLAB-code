Matlab code for linear interpolation without using in-built interp1 function.

Steps to run the code:
Step 1: Copy Interp.m and run.m is same folder.
Step 2: Open run.m file, and set the values of x, v, and xq.
Step 3: Run the run.m. It results executation time for my algorithm and n-built interp1 function.
